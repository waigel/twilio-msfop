# twilio - Mocked server for other providers

## Holy shit, what is this?

Yes this is relatively easy to explain, this `spring-boot` server looks like the twillo api but acts as a proxy to another provider. Currently it is only planned to implement the SMS module. 

The providers can be added via a small and simple plugin interface.

## WIP
Currently all is WIP (work in progress) and you don't schould use this in any case. I work on it ðŸ˜„
